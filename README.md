# Xterm client for OS.js

This is a [xterm.js](https://github.com/sourcelair/xterm.js) application for OS.js.

It allows you to connect to the OS.js server with a real terminal emulator.

## Installation

```
./bin/add-package.sh xterm Xterm https://github.com/os-js/osjs-xterm.git
```

## About

Currently this terminal launches on the same user created by the actual server.

Look forward to the next update for user login support.
